# SCP-Information basic stuff
This is a discord bot that has information about SCPs directly from the SCP wiki.

This bot uses NODE.JS, so install that.

Make sure to check the license!

If self-hosted, please don't delete the license because there be a condition that says you have to include the lisense with the software

# How 2 self-host

First things first: Download this code as a ZIPPED File, and get something like Visual Studio Code.

Two: Change the token in `config.json`. (OPTIONAL) You can change the prefix as well.

Three: Open the console and type this: `node index.js`

Four: There is no four. You're all set.

# Things to know

This code has only like, 7 SCPs. Sooo I'd suggest using the ACTUAL bot so that you can use new SCPs that are added.
