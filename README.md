# SCP-Information Basic Stuff
This is a discord bot that has information about SCPs directly from the SCP wiki.

Make sure to check the license!

If self-hosted, please don't delete the license because there be a condition that says you have to include the lisense with the software

# How 2 self-host

Small thing, respect the license.

Hey, the code uses discord.js, and node.js. So install those first.

First things first: Download this code as a ZIPPED File, and get something like Visual Studio Code.

2: Unzip the file and proceed to open your code editor. 

3: Open the folder that has the code for this bot in it.

4: Change the token in `config.json`. (OPTIONAL) You can change the prefix as well.

5: Run these commands: `npm install --save discord.js`,  `npm install --save sequelize`, then `npm install --save sqlite3`

5: Run the command: node `./currency-stuff/dbInit.js`

5: Open the terminal and type this: `node index.js`

6: Invite your bot, and enjoy. You're all set.

7: I'd suggest add more SCPs.

# Things to know

I am planing on making some parts paid, and those changed will not be recorded here.
